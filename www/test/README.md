In this example mocha and should.js used as is, without any additional tools.

To make it work, do in this folder:
```
npm i
```
Open in browser `index.html`. You will see executed test. This test now in `tests.js`.

Mocha will create such empty files with command `mocha init .`.

Should.js added to `index.html` before `tests.js`.
